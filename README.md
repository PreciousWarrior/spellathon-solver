# Config
Open the python file in a text editor
You can edit a couple of things-:
1. Change `dictionary/words.txt` to `dictionary/lesswords.txt` to use less words and get less solutions. You can of couse edit this with your own dictionary as well.
2. Change min_len to whatever value you want the minimum length of the answer to be

On top of all this, you can obviously modify the source code to your liking
